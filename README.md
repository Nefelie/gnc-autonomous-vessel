# Guidance, Navigation and Control of an Autonomous Vessel
This project focused on the development of an advanced navigation system for an uncrewed vehicle, integrating control algorithms, path planning techniques, and localization methods to ensure precise and autonomous operation.

Key accomplishments include:

- PID Control: Designed and implemented a PID controller for stable and responsive heading and motion control.
- Path Planning: Utilized Artificial Potential Fields to develop an efficient path-planning algorithm that enables the vehicle to navigate dynamic environments while avoiding obstacles.
- Path Following: Integrated Line of Sight (LOS) Guidance for smooth and accurate path following.
- Probabilistic Localization: Applied an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for reliable probabilistic localization and state estimation.
- Sensor and Actuator Integration:
  - Leveraged an IMU for precise heading control.
  - Used ArUco markers for enhanced localization and position tracking.
  - Worked with actuators, including motors with differential thrust, for fine-tuned motion control.
